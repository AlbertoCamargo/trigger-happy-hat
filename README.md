# trigger-happy-hat
Ruby Developer Challenge

As a company we want to track the number of commits per developer per day to give the "trigger happy hat" to the employee with the most commits per month.

For that we need to build either a web or a console ruby program capable to display a line chart of the developers contributions of the last X days
for the top 5 developers with more github contributions in average for those days.

Inputs:
 1. Set of github usernames
 2. Number of days to consider
 3. github organization name (bonus task, instead of usernames)

Output:
 1. Graph for the number of contributions of the last X day for the top 5 users with most contributions in average for those days.
 2. Average number of contributions for each of the top 5 users


Please run
>> bundle install

if it does not works, install manually those gems.
>> gem install  ascii_charts

>> gem install console_view_helper

And then enjoy.
